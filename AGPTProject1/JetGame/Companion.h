//Companions are like “clones” of the spaceship, they also have fire power, can die and get power ups. Basically, they have the 
// same behavior as the Ship, but they are close to the Spaceship.
// When the Spaceship fires, their companions also fire. When the Spaceship dies, the companions also die.
